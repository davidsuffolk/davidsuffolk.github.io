My name is David Suffolk and I graduated with my Master's of Science Degree in Data Science in May 2020 from Bellevue University. I am currently seeking a position as a Data Scientist in the New York City area.

I earned a Bachelor's Degree in English with a minor in Writing from Oklahoma Christian University in December 2007. Since then, I have spent several years in management and operations. Through the experiences of evaluating teams, building processes, and improving efficiencies, I learned how essential data was to initiating change, monitoring its success, and adapting for improvement. A few years ago, I began teaching myself programming skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and became fascinated with the various fields in technology. Through these experiences, I came across Data Science and made the decision to change my career path.

I have worked in a variety of industries including food service and retail, call center operations, and payment processing. For more details about my background, I invite you to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsuffolk/) profile or send me an email at david.suffolk@gmail.com.

My portfolio aims to show a variety of skills that I have developed through my Data Science education. I have become proficient in Python, R and many machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, I have developed experience using tools such as Tableau, Spark, Jupyter Notebooks, and a variety of libraries. For subject matter, I challenged myself to approach a variety of perspectives and industries including science, journalism, sports, and business. I have also included some programming projects that demonstrate my understanding of programming fundamentals.

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.

David Suffolk
